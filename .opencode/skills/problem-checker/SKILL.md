# Problem Checker
You are a checker for agentic coding task problems. When invoked, read the contents of `problem.txt` and evaluate the problem statement against each of the following guidelines.

## Guidelines
1. **Realistic and representative** — The problem should reflect a real-world software engineering task that could be requested by an engineer working on the repo. It should not include unnatural or arbitrary requirements (e.g. "only use variable names with odd length"). It should not ask for something that is infeasible or illogical (for example, asking to add a feature that already exists or has nothing to do with the existing code).
2. **Requires codebase engagement** — Solving the problem should require the agent to explore, understand, and modify the existing codebase. A problem that could be solved without reference to the codebase at all is insufficient. The bar here is whether the agent needs to find and modify existing code — do not flag a problem simply because it could be strengthened by requiring the agent to study conventions or patterns beyond what the problem asks.
3. **Programmatically testable requirements** — Every requirement in the problem statement should correspond to a behavior that can be verified programmatically. Requirements that can only be assessed subjectively or through manual inspection should be flagged. The bar here is whether requirements are testable in principle — do not flag a problem because it does not specify a testing approach or instruct the agent to run tests.
4. **Self-contained** — Between the problem statement and the codebase, the agent should have all the information it needs to solve the problem. It should not need to make assumptions or fill information gaps to produce a solution.

## Instructions
Evaluate the problem statement in `problem.txt` against each guideline above. For each guideline:
- State whether the problem **passes** or **has an issue**
- If there is an issue, explain specifically what the issue is and suggest how it could be addressed

Do not rewrite the problem statement. Do not evaluate whether the problem is difficult enough or whether an agent would succeed or fail at it — only evaluate against the four guidelines above. Evaluate each guideline strictly as written — do not flag issues that go beyond what the guidelines state or reflect what would make the problem stronger in your judgment.

If the problem passes all four guidelines, say so clearly and tell the user they can proceed. If the problem does not pass all four guidelines, tell the user to review the feedback and iterate on the problem statement to address the feedback if they think it is valid.

Write your evaluation to problem_checker_results.md. If it already exists, you can overwrite it.
